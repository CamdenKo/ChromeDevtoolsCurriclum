  <h1>Chrome DevTools Tutorial</h1>
  <div class="marginVert10">
    <h3>Getting started...</h3>
    <p>Google Chrome has lots of amazing tools that help developers speed up their development times drastically. This site will help walk you through using these tools. By the end of this, this site should be beautiful :')</p>

    <h3>Opening tools</h3>
    <p>
      To open dev tools you can click on the Settings on the top-right > Tools > Developer Tools
      <br/>
      I highly recommend learning the keyboard shortcuts:
      <br />
      <br />
      <code>
        Devtools:
        <br/>
        CTRL + SHIFT + I
        <br />
        CMD + OPT + I
        <br />
        <br />
        Devtools > Console:
        <br />
        CTRL + SHIFT + J
        <br />
        CMD + OPT + J
        <br />
        <br />
        Devtools > Inspect Element Mode:
        <br />
        CTRL + SHIFT + C
        <br />
        CMD + SHIFT + C
        <br />
        <br />
      </code>
      Take some time to get used to opening these tools quickly (it'll change your life).

    <h3>Box-Model</h3>
    <p>
      Start by opening up the Devtools.
      <br />
      The devtools should be split into two parts: the "Elements" and the "Styles" tab.
      <br />
      <br />
      The "Elements" tag should be fairly familiar - it's just HTML! Start by hovering over <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code>. The entire page should be colored in blue! Next hover over <code>&lt;body class="container"&gt;</code>. Interesting. There's no longer just blue, but therte's also a brown color on both the left and the right side. One great thing that Google Chrome does for us is split up elements by the
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">
        Box-Model (Now's a good time to review this if you need)
      </a>.
      So the acutal "Content" of the page is colored in
      <p class="backgroundColorContent">
        Blue
      </p>
      The tan color to the side is the
      <p class="backgroundColorMargin">
        Margin
      </p>
      Click on the <code>body</code> tag and watch as the "Styles" half of the page inspector transforms.
    </p>
    <div class="displayFlex flexJustifyContentCenter">
      <img src="boxmodel.png" class="marginVert10"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      Google does a great job here of describing the size of each aspect of the box-model. When you hover one part of the box-model, that part of the box model is highlighted.
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="marginVert10">
    <div>
      <div>
        <div id="hidden">
          Nice Job!
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Navigating "Elements"</h3>
    <p>First make sure that you can see the "Elements" tab. You should be able to see the html of the page.</p>
    <div class="displayFlex flexJustifyContentCenter">
      <img src="Elements.png" class="marginVert10" />
    </div>
    <p>To navigate through, first click on an element. You can then use the Up/Down arrow keys to navigate through sibling elements. To expand/collapse a selection use the left/right arrow keys. Use this to try to find a div with ID "hidden" somewhere in the "Navigating Elements" section.</p>
    <p>
      Another great tool that the Elements section gives us is underneath the HTML view. Right click on the above image and select "inspect". This should now select the img tag inside the Elements tab. You should now see "Img.marginVert10" in white text with a blue background.
    </p>
    <div class="displayFlex flexJustifyContentCenter">
      <img src="inspect.png" class="marginVert10" />
    </div>
    <p>
      This means that I inspected an image tag with the class "marginVert10" looking to the left of that are parent elements. With the oldest parent furthest to the left.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="marginVert10">
    <h3>Editing CSS </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you are comfortable navigating through Chrome Developer Tools, now's your chance to actually <i>develop</i>.
      One of the greatest powers you gain is the edit to live edit CSS inside of the console. Let's start by centering the text below this.
    </p>
    <div id="editMe">
      Center Me!
    </div>
    <p>
      Start by selecting the text in the Developer Tools console. You should now see that the text is surrounded by a div (this is done on purpose). The first thing we're going to learn is how to add <i>existing classes</i> to elements. Select the direct parent of the text, a div with the id "editMeFirst". Now, when you look above the box model you get plenty of different options. The option we are looking for is ".cls"
    </p>
    <div class="displayFlex flexJustifyContentCenter">
      <img src="cls.png" class="marginVert10" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    After clicking on ".cls", a new textbox that says "Add new class" will appear. Inside of that textbox type in "displayFlex" and hit enter to give that div the class, "displayFlex". Inside of the stylesheet I have already defined that class to be "display: flex".
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's add our own rule to the element. Click between the curly braces in "element.style" which should now allow you to type in a new rule. Let's modify the elements justify-content. So type in justify-content and hit "Enter". This should then take you to the other side of the colon, now type in "center" and BLAM, the text is now centered.
